    - When repetition is not allowed, the formula is:
      - n! / r! (n - r)!
    - When repetition is allowed, the formula is:
      - (n + r - 1)! / r! (n - 1)!

  - Permutations
    - Used when the order matters.
    - When repetition is allowed, the formula is:
      - n^r
    - When repetition is not allowed, the formula is:
      - n! / (n - r)!
