# Monitors (Operating Systems)

- Sychronization construct that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to wait (block) for a
  certain condition to become true.

- Typically consists of a mutex (lock) and condition variables.
  - A condition variable is basically a container of threads that are waiting on a certain condition.

- Provides a mechanism for threads to temporarily give up exclusive access in order to wait for some condition to be
  met, before regaining exclusive access and resuming their task.
