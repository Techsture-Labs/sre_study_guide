# System Design

- Distributed Systems
  - The main question of distributed system design is "Did the message get there?"

    - Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance
      - In a distributed system you can only have two, and Partition Tolerance will always be one.  You have to choose between 
        Consistency or Availability.
        - Consistency
          - You only give an answer to a query when you know that you're in sync
        - Availability
          - You give an answer whenever you get a query, whether you're in sync or not
