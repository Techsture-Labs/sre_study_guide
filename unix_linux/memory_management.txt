# Memory Management (UNIX/Linux)

- Linux is a virtual memory system; the addresses seen by user programs do not directly correspond to physical addresses used by the hardware.

- Programs running on the system can allocate more memory than is physically available, such as mapping the program's memory to device memory.

- malloc()
  - Library function implemented in the standard C library and is not a system call.
  - Memory allocated is not initialized.
    - free() frees the memory space pointed to by a previous call to malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().
  - Memory is obtained from the brk()/sbrk() system call, or anonymous memory via mmap().

- The kernel allocates a virtual memory area for the application but does not allocate physical memory.
