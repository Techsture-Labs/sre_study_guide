# Kernel (UNIX/Linux)

- The kernel is a computer program that manages I/O requests from software, and translates them into data processing instructions for the 
  central processing unit and other electronic components of a computer.

- The core part of Linux. It is responsible for all major activities of this operating system. 
  - Consists of various modules and interacts directly with hardware. 
  - Kernel provides the required abstraction to hide low level hardware details from system or application programs.

- The critical code of the kernel is usually loaded into a protected area of memory, which prevents it from being overwritten by other
  applications. 

- The kernel performs its tasks, such as executing processes and handling interrupts, in kernel space.

- Everything a user normally does, such as writing text in a text editor or running programs in a GUI, is done in user space.

- Processes running in user space have normal privileges.

- Processes running in kernel space have all privileges and can do anything.

- Processes switch between user space and kernel space using system calls.

- /etc/sysctl.conf contains kernel parameters that can be modified. You can also use the sysctl command to make changes at runtime.
