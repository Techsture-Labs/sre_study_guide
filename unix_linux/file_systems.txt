- Journaling
  - A journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of changes not yet committed to the file system's main part by recording
    the intentions of such changes in a data structure known as a "journal", which is usually a circular log.
  - After a crash, recovery involves reading the journal from the file system and replaying changes from this journal until the file
    system is consistent again.
    - The changes are "atomic" in that they either succeed or are not replayed at all (skipped because they had not yet been completely
      written to the journal before the crash occurred).
