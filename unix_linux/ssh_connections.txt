# SSH Connections (UNIX/Linux)

- Client opens a TCP connection (3-way handshake is done)
    - Client sends SYN packet
    - Server sends SYN-ACK packet 
    - Client responds with ACK packet

- Server sends its OpenSSH version and public key

- Client checks its supported SSH version and confirms the public key
    - User might get prompted to accept the key if its not present in ~/.ssh/known_hosts file
    - Continue if the protocol matches and client accepts the key

- SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT message is sent/received (KEX algorithm negotiation)
    - Client sends its KEX algorithms, host key algorithms, ciphers
        - KEX Algorithm: Variant of Diffie-Hellman algorithms
        - Host key Algorithm: Public key crypto algorithm
        - Cipher: cacha-poly1305 > aes256-gcm > aes128-gcm etc
    - First match of algorithms on clients side is selected for the session
