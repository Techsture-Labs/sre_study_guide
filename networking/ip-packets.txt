# IP Packets (Networking)

- All are structured the same way; an IP header followed by a variable-length data field.  Header fields are as follows:

  - Version
    - Indicates the format of the Internet header.

  - IHL (Internet Header Length)
    - The length of the Internet header, which points to the beginning of the data.

  - Type of Service
    - Defines parameters about the desired QoS.

  - Total Length
    - Length of the datagram, including header and data.

  - Identification
    - Assigned by the sender to add in assembling the fragments of a datagram.

  - Flags
    - Various control flags.

  - Fragment Offset
    - Indicates where in the datagram the fragment belongs.

  - Time To Live (TTL)
    -  The maximum time the datagram is allowed to remain in the Internet system in seconds.

  - Protocol
    - Indicates the next level protocol used in the data portion of the datagram.

  - Header Checksum
    - Checksum for header only.
    - Since some header fields change, this is verified and recomputed at each point that the header is processed.

  - Source Address

  - Destination Address

  - Options

  - Padding
    - Used to ensure that the header ends on a 32-bit boundry.
