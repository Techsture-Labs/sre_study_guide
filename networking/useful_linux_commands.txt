# Useful Linux Networking Commands

- dig
  - Domain information utility; find information about a specific address, such as CNAME, A Record, etc.
  - Example: dig www.google.com
    - Get DNS information related to www.google.com.  Note this will return different information than just "dig google.com", because it 
      goes one level deeper into Google's nameservers.

- ifconfig
  - Network interface configuration utility
  - Any changes made using this command will not persist after a reboot.
    - Persistent changes should be made to files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ (RHEL-based systems)
  - Examples:
    - ifconfig
      - Simply displays current configuration of the network interfaces

- ifdown [interface_name]
  - Disable a network interface
  - Example: ifdown eth0
    - Enable eth0 interface

- ifup [interface_name]
  - Enable a network interface
  - Example: ifup eth0
    - Disable eth0 interface

- netstat
  - Display currently open Internet connections and UNIX sockets
  - Examples:
    - netstat -g
      - Show interface group memberships
    - netstat -i
      -  Show interface transaction counts
    - netstat -r
      - Show Kernel routing table
    - netstat -s
      -  Show statistics
    - The following can be mixed together to parse the information easier
      - netstat -a
        - Show all open connections and sockets, including those in a LISTEN state
        - Useful if you're running a server, to make sure the proper ports are open
      - netstat -c
        -  Continuously call netstat.  
        - Can be coupled with "watch" or piped to "grep" so you can find system changes easier:
          - watch netstat -clau
      - netstat -l
        - Show all connections currently in a LISTEN/LISTENING state
      - netstat -p
        - Show all connections with process list
      - netstat -t
        - Show all open TCP connections and sockets
      - netstat -u
        -  Show all open UDP connections and sockets
      
- nslookup
  - Show nameserver information for remote system
  - Similar to "dig"
  - Example: nslookup google.com
    - Shows nameserver information for google.com

- ping
  - Test connectivity between client and server
  - Uses ICMP
  - Example: ping 8.8.8.8
    - Pings 8.8.8.8 indefinitely (CTRL+C to stop)
  - Example: ping -c 5 www.google.com
    - Pings www.google.com 5 times and stops

- route
  - Show and change routing table
  - Examples:
    - route -n
      - Show routing table using numerical IP addresses
    - route 

- traceroute
  - Show all the hops between client and server
  - Example: traceroute google.com
