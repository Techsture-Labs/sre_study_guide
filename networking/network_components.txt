# Network Components

- DNS (Networking)
    - Domain Name System
    - Naming system for resources connected to Internet or private networks.
    - Translates domain names to IP addresses.
    - A DNS name server stores the DNS records for a domain name and responds with answers to queries 
        against its database.

- Firewalls
    - Network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic
        based on predetermined security rules.
    - Categorized as network or host-based.

- Load Balancers
    - Distributes workloads across multiple computing resources using a preconfigured algorithm
    - Algorithm Examples:
      - Random
      - Round Robin
        - Just goes around in a loop
      - Weighted Round Robin
        - Same as round robin, except some servers get a larger share of the overall traffic.
      - Source IP
        - Connections are distributed to the backend servers based on a hash of the source IP address.
        - As long as all servers are running, a give client IP address will always go to the same web server.
      - URL
        - Connections are distributed to the backend servers based on a hash of the URL request.
        - Useful when balancing in front of caches since requests for a given object will always go to just one backend cache, avoiding cache duplication.
      - Least Connections
        - Load balancer monitors the number of open connections for each server and sends to the least busy of them.
      - Least Traffic
        - Load balancer monitors the bitrate from each server and sends to the one with the least amount of outgoing traffic.
      - Least Latency
        - A simple request is made to each server and the load is sent to the first responder.

- MAC Addresses
    - Media Access Control Address or Physical Address
    - Unique identifier assigned to network interfaces.
    - 48-bit (6 octets)

- Routers
    - Forwards data packets between computer networks.
    - Perform the "traffic directing" functions of Internet.
