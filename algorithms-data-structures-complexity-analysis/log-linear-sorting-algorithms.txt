- Quick Sort
  - Pick an element from the array (the pivot)
  - Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot and all elements with values larger than the pivot come after it.  Equal values can go either way.
  - Recursively apply the first two steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of elements with larger values.

- Merge Sort
  - Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
  - Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.

- Heap Sort
