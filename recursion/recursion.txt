# Recursion

- A method where the solution to a problem depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

- This example calls it self until all of the elements in the list have been accounted for.
  def sum(list):
    if len(list) == 1:
      return list[0]
    else:
      return list[0] + sum(list[1:])
  print(sum([5,7,3,8,10]))
